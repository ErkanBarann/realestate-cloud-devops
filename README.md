# Project â€“ Real Estate Cloud DevOps

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **end-to-end DevOps pipeline** for a real estate application on AWS.  
It covers infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, container orchestration, and cloud-native monitoring using modern DevOps tools.

## Project Modules

### âœ… Module 1: Modular Virtual Machine Creation on AWS  
Provisioned EC2 instances using **Terraform** and automated provisioning with **Jenkins** pipelines.

### âœ… Module 2: Infrastructure Configuration with Ansible  
Configured and managed EC2 instances using **Ansible**, fully automated through **Jenkins**. Built upon Module 1.

### âœ… Module 3: Application Deployment with Docker Compose  
Built Docker images and pushed them to **AWS ECR**, deployed the application on EC2 using **Docker Compose**, and automated the workflow with **Jenkins**.

### âœ… Module 4: Migration to Kubernetes  
Containerized the application with **Kompose**, deployed it on **K3s**, managed with **kubectl**, and integrated automation via **Jenkins**.

### âœ… Module 5: Deployment on AWS EKS with Helm  
Deployed the application on **AWS EKS** using **Helm**, configured **Nginx Ingress**, and set up monitoring with **Prometheus & Grafana**. Fully automated via **Jenkins** pipelines.

### âœ… Module 6: Kubernetes Management with Rancher and EFK Stack  
Created and managed a Kubernetes cluster with **Rancher**, deployed the application using GitOps-based **Helm charts**, visualized the cluster with **Kubernetes Lens**, and implemented centralized logging with the **EFK stack** (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).

---

## Tools & Technologies  
**Infrastructure:** Terraform, Ansible, AWS (EC2, VPC, IAM, EKS, ECR)  
**CI/CD & Automation:** Jenkins, Git, GitHub  
**Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Helm, Kompose, Kustomize, Rancher  
**Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana), Lens  

---

## Outcome  
By leveraging modern DevOps practices, Kubernetes, and AWS cloud infrastructure, this project simulates a **real-world enterprise CI/CD pipeline**.  
It demonstrates expertise across the full DevOps lifecycle â€” from **infrastructure as code** and **configuration management**, to **containerized deployments**, **Kubernetes orchestration**, and **cloud-native monitoring**.
